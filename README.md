# Topological-Data-Analysis
Exploring study of the shape of data using topology techniques in data analysis and inference
1.

The file “weather.csv” contains temperature, pressure, humidity etc. measurements
of a Canadian city. In particular, these measurements were taken every hour of every day
during January of 2018. First, analyse the temperature Vs. pressure data for the entire month.
Then study the three variables - temperature, pressure and relative humidity for the month. Is
there any interesting pattern when you study relationships between these variables on a weekly
basis? Can you use above analysis to predict weather for the first week of February? If your
answer is yes then explain your predictions.

2.

The file “price_comparison.csv” contains prices of two different currency rates
during lots of consecutive days. The first column contains the rate for 1 unit of X country’s
currency and the second column contains the rate for Y’s currency. Determine and describe
prominent topological features present in the data. Analyse the topology of the level sets of the
kernel distance estimator. What do the topological features obtained in the above two analysis
tell you about the data? Do these features help you explain correlation between the two currency
rates?
